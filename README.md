# YouthBooster
Youth Booster is a mobile application that helps the young innovators and visionaries launch their projects or startups. It will accompany them to make sure their ideas become a reality. In fact it is more than just an application. It has the power to change the future of societies by helping the youth, leaders of tomorrow, to influence their surroundings and show their true potential. This is achieved by connecting them together and providing them with all they need to bring their ideas to the real world.

Our application aims to connect project ideas in all domains with the rest of the world to boost and give them the attention they deserve. It offers its users the ability to form teams within the projects. Anyone can send a request to the project owner to join their team and collaborate with them by filling a certain role. We want to make it easier for investors to find projects worth investing in, in their regions and for our creative youth to get the funding they need!

For our profit, we chose to take just 5% of all donations made inside the app.

The app will show slides for new-comers to help guide them and improve their experience in it! It is a cross-platform mobile application made using the Ionic3 framework. It has Firebase integration and uses Google authentication to make it easy for users to link their accounts on these platforms.

Upon opening the app, the user will need to sign in or create an account(where he will fill the required information be it personal information, technical background, or even payment credentials if he wishes to receive donations via our app). Then he will be redirected to the categories page to choose one and browse the projects in that category. There, he can search for the ideas that interests him using our search filter. He can filter based on the number of likes and views, the project’s rating, the project’s name or the owner’s name or the date of publication. If he chooses to click on a project, it will open in a separate page for him to view more of it in details. There, he can choose to like it(add it to his bookmarks page), write a comment(give feedback, ask questions …), donate to it, send a request to the owner to be part of the project’s team. He can also open the profile of the owner to know more about him(maybe chat with him).
Similarly, when one chooses to publish a new idea of his, he will need to fill the required information(title, thumbnail picture of the project/idea, detailed description or summary, tags) or/and add other attachments(pictures, videos and other files), all of which can be modified again anytime he wants.
After that, he will be able to see the list of project publications he made and the team members in each one.
If at any time his idea got all the support(be it money or other collaborators) and he no longer wants to be shown in our app, he can choose to archive it(thus adding it to his archive list), that way it will be kept in our database and he can choose to re-add it again in the future.

There will be a side menu to the left to make it easy for our users to navigate between their profile page, bookmarks list, archive and their conversations with other users.

We also have notification prompts! They will show up once you open our app or after you sign in(if you’re not already signed in) and they will notify you of any donations that have been made to one of your projects, any join requests to one of your teams or if you get accepted into a team.

We later plan to add many more categories in order to accept as many innovative ideas as we can in our application, integrate LinkedIn and GitHub, add the ability to share posts on famous social media sites…
